James Strickler, JD PhD was born in the small town of Sweet\n            Home, Oregon (population 6,000), where he was raised by his single\n            mother along with two siblings. After serving for two years as a\n            missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he\n            enrolled at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. He is the\n            first generation in his family to attend college. At BYU, he earned\n            a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science & History Teaching.\n            He then attended the J. Reuben Clark Law School at BYU, where he\n            earned a Juris Doctorate. He next earned a Doctor of Philosophy\n            Degree, in American Politics, from Stanford University in Palo Alto,\n            California. Dr. Strickler now has over 2O years of experience\n            teaching at colleges and universities, including at Valdosta State\n            University, Utah State University, San Jose State University,\n            Brigham Young University, and Stanford University. He has published\n            numerous scholarly works in such places as the Harvard International\n            Journal of Press/Politics and the Georgia Law Review, and with\n            Cambridge University Press.\n            <br />\n            <img src=\"./images/James-Strickler.JPG\" id=\"James\" alt=\"\" />\n            <br />\n            At the time that Dr. Strickler entered his graduate studies at\n            Stanford, he also married his wife, Kathleen. While he was in\n            graduate school, she gave birth to the first four of their eight\n            children. Those eight children now range in age from 18 years old to\n            6 years old. Because Kathleen suffers from several health problems,\n            Dr. Strickler has often been both the income earner for his family\n            and the primary care giver for his children. Nonetheless, his\n            children have excelled in both academics and extracurricular\n            activities. Dr. Strickler’s two oldest children each graduated from\n            high school in just three years at the age of 16 and earned full\n            academic scholarships to Brigham Young University. Both were also\n            named as the “Star Student” of their graduating classes for having\n            achieved the highest scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) of\n            any student in their region of the State of Georgia. Both were also\n            recognized as National Merit Scholars and by the State of Georgia as\n            Georgia Scholars. Dr. Strickler’s third child will graduate from\n            high school at nearly a year younger than the first two, and with\n            even higher tests scores. Dr. Strickler’s younger children are also\n            the top students in their classes. His children play piano and\n            participate in such activities as math competitions, robotics\n            competitions, choir competitions, Scouting, theater arts, and\n            various sports.

She is personable teacher, a professional editor with a\n            degree in Communications, Journalism, and a mother of four children.\n            As a lifelong learner, she has a constant thirst for knowledge and\n            is passionate about sharing what she has learned with others. From a\n            young age she began playing school and only dreaming about teaching\n            in a real classroom until she could enjoy teaching everything from\n            elementary to university classes.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            After graduation from Brigham Young University, Krista immediately\n            journeyed to Mainland China. There, she worked in a university’s\n            English Department editing all things English and coaching graduate\n            students in academic writing. After residing several more years in\n            Taiwan and Thailand, where she did technical business editing,\n            Krista returned to the States and contracted work editing for\n            websites, master’s theses and graduate school applications. She has\n            also written multiple short stories for children, including a\n            treatment for animation. She treasures quality time with her own\n            family as well as connecting with her beloved global “family.”\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Her experiences now include teaching at a university in Chongqing,\n            teaching elementary classes in Taiwan, privately tutoring learning\n            disabled children, preparing students for college exams, teaching in\n            her state's top charter school, and homeschooling her own children\n            for several years. Most recently, Krista has helped found a new\n            charter school based on Montessori and entrepreneurship principles\n            that opened this fall.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div classname={classes.divider} />\n        <div className={classes.member} id=\"Michael\">\n          <img src=\"./images/Michael-Dayton.png\" alt=\"\" />\n          <h2>Michael Dayton—Mandarin Presenter and Camp Facilitator</h2>\n          <p>\n            Michael is a member of the US Army, a student at Utah Valley\n            University, a certified auto mechanic, and an Eagle Scout who speaks\n            Mandarin.
